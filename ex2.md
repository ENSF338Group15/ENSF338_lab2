1. One aspect that makes interpolation search better than binary search is that the midpoint is set to the position where the item is likely to occur, leading to faster search times. Another aspect is that interpolation search is more efficient when it comes to larger datasets. Additionally, interpolation search works well with uniformly distributed data.

2. If the data follows a different distribution, it will affect the performance of the interpolation search. This is because it is reliant on working with data that is uniformly distributed. If the data is not uniformly distributed, the algorithm may make an inaccurate estimate of the position the item should occur when setting the midpoint leading to inefficient searching.

3. If we wanted to modify the interpolation search to follow a different distribution, the calculation when the algorithm estimates the position of the item in the array would be affected.

4. Linear search is the only option for searching data when binary and interpolation search may fail when the data is unsorted because binary and interpolation search requires data that is sorted.

5. Linear search can outperform both binary and interpolation search in cases involving small datasets because of the simplicity that comes with linear se

6. One way to improve binary and interpolation search to solve the issue mentioned above is by implementing hybrid search. Hybrid search will improve performance by switching between linear and binary/interpolation search to best complement the dataset.
